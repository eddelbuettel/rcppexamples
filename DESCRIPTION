Description: Examples for Seamless R and C++ integration
 The Rcpp package contains a C++ library that facilitates the integration of
 R and C++ in various ways. This package provides some usage examples.
 .
 Note that the documentation in this package currently does not cover all the
 features in the package. It is not even close. 
 .
 It does however provide a few example based on both the (deprecated)
 `classic' API and the current Rcpp API which supercedes it. As such, it 
 can help in porting from the older API to the newer API.
Depends: R (>= 2.11.0), Rcpp (>= 0.9.9), RcppClassic
LinkingTo: RcppClassic, Rcpp
Suggests: RUnit
