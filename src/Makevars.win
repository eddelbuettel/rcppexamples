## Emacs please make this a -*- mode: Makefile; -*-

## We could set particular variables for Windows here. Examples are
##    PKG_LIBS      for external libraries
##    PKG_CPPFLAGS  for compilation preprocessor flags
##    PKG_CXXFLAGS  for additional compiler flags
##    CXX_STD       to select a compilation standard
## But for standard builds without external dependencies, nothing is needed
